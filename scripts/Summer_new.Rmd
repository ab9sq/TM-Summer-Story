```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### load the corpus

```{r load, tidy=FALSE}
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
library(ggplot2)
txt <- DirSource(directory = "../Data")
story.1st <- Corpus(txt)
story.raw.1st <- story.1st
story.1st <- tm_map(story.1st,  content_transformer(tolower))
story.1st <- tm_map(story.1st,  content_transformer(removePunctuation))
story.1st <- tm_map(story.1st,  content_transformer(removeNumbers))
story.1st <- tm_map(story.1st, removeWords, stopwords('english'))
story.1st.copy <- story.1st
summary(story.1st)
story.1st
meta(story.1st[[1]])
```
### Analysis
```{r analysis, fig.width=11, fig.height=8, tidy=FALSE}
story.1st.stem  <- tm_map(story.1st, stemDocument)


myTdm.1st <- TermDocumentMatrix(story.1st, control=list(minWordLength = 1))
myTdm.1st
myTdm.1st.s <- TermDocumentMatrix(story.1st.stem, control=list(minWordLength = 1))
myTdm.1st.s


findFreqTerms(myTdm.1st, lowfreq = 10)
termFreq.1st <- rowSums(as.matrix(myTdm.1st))
termFreq.1st <- subset(termFreq.1st, termFreq.1st >=9)

qplot(names(termFreq.1st), termFreq.1st, geom="bar",xlab="Terms")+coord_flip()
barplot(termFreq.1st, las=2)

m.1st <-as.matrix(myTdm.1st)
wordFreq.1st <- sort(rowSums(m.1st), decreasing=TRUE)
set.seed(12345)
wordcloud(words=names(wordFreq.1st),
          freq = wordFreq.1st,
          min.freq=20,
          random.order = F)
```
now do it with stemmed and rebuild
```{r stem and re, fig.width=11, fig.height=8, tidy=FALSE}
story.comp.1st <- tm_map(story.1st.stem, stemCompletion, dictionary=story.1st.copy)

myTdm.comp.1st <- TermDocumentMatrix(story.comp.1st, control=list(minWordLength = 1))
myTdm.comp.1st

findFreqTerms(myTdm.comp.1st, lowfreq = 500)
termFreq.comp.1st <- rowSums(as.matrix(myTdm.comp.1st))
termFreq.comp.1st <- subset(termFreq.comp.1st, termFreq.comp >=500)

qplot(names(termFreq.comp.1st), termFreq.comp, geom="bar",xlab="Terms")+coord_flip()
barplot(termFreq.comp.1st, las=2)

m.comp.1st <- as.matrix(myTdm.comp.1st)
wordFreq.comp.1st <- sort(rowSums(m.comp.1st), decreasing=TRUE)
set.seed(12345)
wordcloud(words=names(wordFreq.comp.1st),
          freq = wordFreq.comp.1st,
          min.freq=20,
          random.order = F,
          rot.per = .1)
